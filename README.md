# Unsupervised-Learning

I have applied unsupervised techniques on real world datasets and also built the knowledge of python along the way. In particular, I used scikit-learn and scipy for unsupervised learning challenges. I harnessed both clustering and dimension reduction techniques to tackle problems with real world datasets such as clustering wikipedia documents by the words they contain and recommending musical artists to consumers.

I also used data exploration techniques to find the right number of clusters for a dataset, transformed data for better clustering, and visualized hierarchical clustering and t-sne. Furthermore, I used dimension reduction using PCA and built recommender systems using NMF.

I also used clustering techniques to do customers segmentation according to their income and buying behavior which can be helpful for organizations to target their customers more effectively.
